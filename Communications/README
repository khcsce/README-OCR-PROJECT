All Files use paho.mqtt which can be downloaded with pip install paho-mqtt

Gesture control publisher and subscriber: Sends a text stream to user
Text publisher and subscriber: Send text between 2 users. 

To use run start the subscriber then the publisher to send data between. 


Future improvements: Going to replace this with a TCP/IP socket to send the image taken not the OCR text in the future.
